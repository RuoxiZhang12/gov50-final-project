## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to 
- mental health and election (dem/rep), other factors could include unemp, college grad/non-college grad, mean age in country
- college grad percentage and support for increase tax on 1% richest people policy, other factors could include unemp, social mobility, dem/rep geographical areas (link with Raj Chetty's research on social mobility and higher education?)
